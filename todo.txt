see if training on text helps to make text valuable. right now
it seems that epoch3 doesnt benefit from the addition of text embeddings but the other one does...

currently im training a model with increased noise in case that was the problem. going from 0.15 ->0.33
if that doesnt help text be useful, then i will additionally add the text perturbations back in
to see if we recover the same beenfits of text pushing us from 0.7392 to 0.7563 (not the epoch3 one)
albeit still lower than the 0.77 i get in the other code...

alright just tried conf 03 that simply increased the noise amount to 0.33 and the result went up to
0.74 without text, 0.762 with text! no text perturbations. I will now re add text perturbations and see if
it makes more difference.


okay so conf02 is actually only mildly better than conf00, there was a proble, with text addition before
so it seems even conf00 also gets to 0.77 with text now! but i prefer conf02 so will stick with that.
still, i will need to try perturbations on text to see if there any benefits.


adding perturbations onto text didnt seem to help
